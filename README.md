# SMARTFARMER
SMARTFARMER aims to develop and make available a digital information service that provides farmers in western Kenya - including smallholders - with information that helps them to make improved farm management decisions during the growing season. SMARTFARMER project will further develop our agro advisory service by integrating satellite imagery with weather data, soil data and farm management information through the WOFOST crop model to provide farmers with practical advice and recommendations exactly when they need it. This information will be used to make comprehensible, farm and crop specific recommendations for farmer practices, which will be disseminated to the farmers via SMS.
